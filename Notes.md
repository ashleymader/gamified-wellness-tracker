- [x] Using Ruby on Rails for the project
- [x] Include at least one has_many relationship (x has_many y; e.g. User has_many Recipes) 
- [x] Include at least one belongs_to relationship (x belongs_to y; e.g. Post belongs_to User)
- [x] Include at least two has_many through relationships (x has_many y through z; e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients)
- [x] Include at least one many-to-many relationship (x has_many y through z, y has_many x through z; e.g. Recipe has_many Items through Ingredients, Item has_many Recipes through Ingredients)
- [x] The "through" part of the has_many through includes at least one user submittable attribute, that is to say, some attribute other than its foreign keys that can be submitted by the app's user (attribute_name e.g. ingredients.quantity)
- [x] Include reasonable validations for simple model objects (list of model objects with validations e.g. User, Recipe, Ingredient, Item)

- [x] Include nested resource "new" form (URL e.g. recipes/1/ingredients/new)
- [x] Include form display of validation errors (form URL e.g. /recipes/new)

Confirm:
- [ ] The application is pretty DRY
- [ ] Limited logic in controllers
- [ ] Views use helper methods if appropriate
- [ ] Views use partials if appropriate


TO-DO list:
- [x] Watch MyBlog last video about validation and errors
- [x] Check all error messages if they are working
- [x] Login error message not showing!!!
- [x] Decided not to go too far for styling (for now), stick to MVP
- [x] Check if you can log in via Google without choosing team over and over again.


What to expect in Reviews:
Similar to Sinatra, walkthrough authentication, how you meet those requirements, live coding is a step up, query methods, using where joins, order, generate SQL, active record model class method, look more into query methods
